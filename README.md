# DataStructures-Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms using C++. It aims to provide a comprehensive collection of commonly used data structures and algorithms, serving as a reference and learning resource for C++ programmers.

## Contents
The repository currently includes the following data structures and algorithms:

- Singly Linked List (SLL)
- Queue
- Stack
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- AVL Tree
- Min Heap as class
- ### By ahanfybekheet:
  * Heaps as functions
  * Radix sort
- ### By YoussefMoataz:
  * Insertion Sort
  * Selection Sort
  * Bubble Sort
  * Shell Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Counting Sort
  * Double Linked List
